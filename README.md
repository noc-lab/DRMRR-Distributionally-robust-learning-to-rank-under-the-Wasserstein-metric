# DRMRR: Distributionally Robust Learning-To-Rank Under the Wasserstein Metric


Python implementation of models introduced in the paper "Distributionally robust learning-to-rank under the Wasserstein metric" by Shahabeddin Sotudian et. al.
Regardless of their satisfactory performance, most existing listwise {\em Learning-To-Rank (LTR)} models overlooked the crucial matter of robustness. A data set can be contaminated in various ways, including human error in labeling or annotation, distributional data shift, and malicious adversaries who wish to degrade the algorithmâ€™s performance. It has been shown that {\em Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO)} is resilient against various types of noise and perturbations. To fill this gap, we introduce a new listwise LTR model called {\em Distributionally Robust Multi-output Regression Ranking (DRMRR)}. Different from existing methods, the scoring function of DRMRR was designed as a multivariate mapping from a feature vector to a vector of deviation scores, which captures local context information and cross-document interactions. In this way, we are able to incorporate the LTR metrics into our model. DRMRR uses a Wasserstein DRO framework to minimize a multi-output loss function under the most adverse distributions in the neighborhood of the empirical data distribution defined by a Wasserstein ball. We present a compact and computationally solvable reformulation of the min-max formulation of DRMRR. Our experiments were conducted on two real-world applications: medical document retrieval and drug response prediction, showing that DRMRR notably outperforms state-of-the-art LTR models. We also conducted an extensive analysis to examine the resilience of DRMRR against various types of noise: Gaussian noise, adversarial perturbations, and label poisoning. Accordingly, DRMRR is not only able to achieve significantly better performance than other baselines, but it can maintain a relatively stable performance as more noise is added to the data.
